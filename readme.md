## sparkNeo

This is an attempt to extend sparklyr using the neo4j spark connector [neo4j spark connector](https://spark-packages.org/package/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-spark-connector) (by Michael Hunger). The github repo for the connector is [here](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-spark-connector)

The combination of Neo4j and Spark seems interesting to do large scale graph analysis from the comfort of Rstudio. 


### This package is currently non functional and is mainly used to get feedback / help in making sparkNeo a reality.
